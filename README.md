## Part 1: Timing Code

### Tasks

- Create some code that returns the time needed to execute a function.
- What if you make the array passed into the functions 10, 100, 1000, 10000 times bigger?
- In order to get further, we'll need to create graphs to compare different pieces of code. You will transform your code into a _timing framework_. It should:
  - Create arrays of different sizes (try 5000 to 100000 in steps of 5000)
  - Run the code to time on each
  - Print the size and corresponding time.
- From there, you should use a spreadsheet utility to plot the results into a curve (time spent over input size).

### "I can TDD anything"

- Create some code that returns the time needed to execute a function
